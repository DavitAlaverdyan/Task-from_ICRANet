In our dataset, I observed a particular pattern where the difference between the 'start time' and 'end time' columns is sometimes zero and sometimes non-zero. Specifically, when this difference is zero, I noticed that the corresponding 'nufnu' values are not zero. Conversely, when the difference is not zero, the 'nufnu' values tend to be zero.
Upon further analysis, I found that this inconsistency in the relationship between time difference and 'nufnu' values suggests a potential data inconsistency or error. As a result, I have decided to drop the 'start time' and 'end time' columns from my dataset.

In my analysis, I observed instances where the 'nufnu' values were higher than the corresponding 'nufnu_upper' values and lower than the 'nufnu_lower' values. This inconsistency is unexpected and suggests potential errors or anomalies in the data.
After careful consideration, I decided to remove these data points from my dataset. By doing so, I aim to ensure the reliability and accuracy of my analysis results. Removing these inconsistent data points helps maintain data integrity and prevents them from influencing the interpretation of my findings.

After further analysis, I observed a high correlation between the 'nufnu' column and the 'nufnu_lower' column, as well as between the 'nufnu' column and the 'nufnu_upper' column. This high correlation suggests that the information provided by the 'nufnu' and 'nufnu_upper' columns is redundant, as both columns convey similar information about the lower and upper bounds of the flux density measurement.

Based on this observation, I made the decision to delete both the 'nufnu' and 'nufnu_upper' columns from my dataset.

The relationship between "nufnu" and "redshift" or "frequency" may is not linear.
